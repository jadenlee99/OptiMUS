    "description": "Mrs. Watson wants to invest in the real-estate market and has a total budget of at most $760000. She has two choices which include condos and detached houses. Each dollar invested in condos yields a $0.50 profit and each dollar invested in detached houses yields a $1 profit. A minimum of 20% of all money invested must be in condos, and at least $20000 must be in detached houses. Formulate an LP that can be used to maximize total profit earned from Mrs. Watson's investment.",
