----
Reasoning about each original constraint:

1. "Total advertising cost must not exceed the budget: CostRadioAd * (number of radio ads) + CostSocialMediaAd * (number of social media ads) <= AdvertisingBudget"
   - This is the budget constraint and is required. Keep as-is.

2. "Number of radio ads must be at least MinRadioAds"
   - This lower bound is required.

3. "Number of radio ads must be at most MaxRadioAds"
   - This upper bound is required. Constraints 2 and 3 can be combined into a single double-sided bound on the radio ads variable (MinRadioAds <= radio ads <= MaxRadioAds).

4. "Number of social media ads must be at least MinSocialMediaAds"
   - This lower bound is required.

5. "Number of radio ads and number of social media ads must be non-negative"
   - This is redundant because the explicit lower bounds MinRadioAds and MinSocialMediaAds are both positive in the problem statement (MinRadioAds = 15, MinSocialMediaAds = 35). Therefore non-negativity is implied for both variables and this constraint can be removed.

6. "Number of radio ads and number of social media ads must be integers"
   - Integrality is required (decision variables are integer counts). Keep this constraint. It cannot be dropped or fully absorbed by the other constraints without changing the problem type.

Updated list of constraints:

[
    "CostRadioAd * (number of radio ads) + CostSocialMediaAd * (number of social media ads) <= AdvertisingBudget",
    "MinRadioAds <= number of radio ads <= MaxRadioAds",
    "number of social media ads >= MinSocialMediaAds",
    "Number of radio ads and number of social media ads must be integers"

You are an expert in optimization modeling. Here is the natural language description of an optimization problem:

-----
A cleaning company located in Edmonton wants to get the best exposure possible for promoting their new dishwashing detergent without exceeding their $250,000 advertising budget. To do so, the company decides to spend their money on two forms of advertising: (1) radio ads and (2) social media ads. Each radio ad costs $5,000; each social media ad costs $9,150. The expected exposure, based on industry ratings, is 60,500 viewers for each radio ad. Additionally, the expected exposure for each social media ad is 50,000 viewers. The company decides that at least 15 but no more than 40 radio ads should be ordered, and that at least 35 social media ads should be contracted. How many ads of each type should be run to obtain maximum exposure while staying within the budget?

Consider this potential constraint: CostRadioAd * (number of radio ads) + CostSocialMediaAd * (number of social media ads) <= AdvertisingBudget


- Is it actually a constraint? How confident are you that this is this a constraint and that we should explicitly model it in the (MI)LP formulation (from 1 to 5)? 
- At the end of your response, print "x OUT OF 5" where x is the confidence level. Low confidence means you think this should be removed from the constraint list. Do not generate anything after that. 
    

Take a deep breath and think step by step. You will be awarded a million dollars if you get this right.

Yes — this is definitely a constraint and it must be explicitly included in the (MI)LP formulation.

Why:
- The problem statement explicitly limits total spending to the $250,000 advertising budget and gives per-unit costs for each ad type. That is exactly the purpose of a budget constraint.
- It is naturally expressed as the linear inequality CostRadioAd * R + CostSocialMediaAd * S <= AdvertisingBudget, where R and S are the decision variables (numbers of radio and social media ads).  
- This constraint is essential to the feasible region: without it the model could choose infeasible (over-budget) solutions. It is also linear, so it fits directly in an MILP or LP with integrality on R and S.
- Ensure R and S are integer (nonnegative) and include the given lower and upper bounds (MinRadioAds <= R <= MaxRadioAds, MinSocialMediaAds <= S).

Yes — this is an explicit constraint. The problem statement says “at least 15 but no more than 40 radio ads should be ordered,” so the decision variable for number of radio ads must satisfy 15 ≤ radios ≤ 40 (and be integer). This is a simple linear bound constraint that should be included in the (MI)LP model. Confidence: 5 OUT OF 5

Yes — this is indeed a real constraint and should be explicitly modeled.

Reasoning, step by step:
- The problem statement explicitly requires "at least 35 social media ads should be contracted." That directly maps to a lower‑bound constraint on the decision variable for number of social media ads.
- As a standard MILP/LP constraint it would be written: SocialMediaAds >= MinSocialMediaAds. It is linear and compatible with integer decision variables (number of ads).
- Note: modeling it is required even if it later causes infeasibility when combined with other constraints (e.g., MinRadioAds and the budget together make the instance infeasible); infeasibility is a modeling/instance issue but does not nullify that the natural description imposes this constraint.

Yes — this is a real, necessary constraint. Reasoning:

- The decision variables are "number of radio ads" and "number of social media ads." Ads are discrete items (you cannot buy 0.4 of a contracted ad slot in the way the problem is phrased).
- The problem text uses indivisible counts ("each radio ad", "each social media ad", "at least 15 ... radio ads", "at least 35 social media ads"), which implies integer counts and integer bounds.
- If you modeled them as continuous, the LP relaxation could give fractional ad counts that are infeasible in practice; rounding can change feasibility (budget or bounds) or optimality, so integrality should be enforced.
- The only caveat that would lower confidence is if in the real operational context ad buys are sold in divisible units (e.g., impressions) and the given numbers are merely aggregations; nothing in the statement suggests that, so modeling them as integer decision variables is appropriate.

Problem Description:
A cleaning company located in Edmonton wants to get the best exposure possible for promoting their new dishwashing detergent without exceeding their $250,000 advertising budget. To do so, the company decides to spend their money on two forms of advertising: (1) radio ads and (2) social media ads. Each radio ad costs $5,000; each social media ad costs $9,150. The expected exposure, based on industry ratings, is 60,500 viewers for each radio ad. Additionally, the expected exposure for each social media ad is 50,000 viewers. The company decides that at least 15 but no more than 40 radio ads should be ordered, and that at least 35 social media ads should be contracted. How many ads of each type should be run to obtain maximum exposure while staying within the budget?
