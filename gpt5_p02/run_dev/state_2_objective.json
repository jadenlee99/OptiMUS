    "description": "A breakfast joint makes two different sandwiches: a regular and a special. Both need eggs and bacon. Each regular sandwich requires 2 eggs and 3 slices of bacon. Each special sandwich requires 3 eggs and 5 slices of bacon. The joint has a total of 40 eggs and 70 slices of bacon. It makes a profit of $3 per regular sandwich and a profit of $4 per special sandwich. How many of each sandwich should be made to maximize profit?",
